# sudoku_recursive
This project is a Python-based implementation of a Sudoku solver. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in a 9x9 Sudoku grid, finding a solution that satisfies all the constraints of a standard Sudoku puzzle. The grid is initially populated with some numbers, and the objective is to fill in the remaining empty cells.
